CLIPSJNI
========

In this project I will apply [https://sourceforge.net/p/clipsrules/discussion/776945/thread/01312882 some improvements] to the original [https://sourceforge.net/projects/clipsrules/ CLIPSJNI] project:

 * More "standardized" package name (e.g. something like net.sf.clipsrules)
 * Throwing exceptions instead of printing errors on the stdout
 * Documenting the Environment class methods a little bit
 * Mavenizing the project
 * Creating an OSGi compliant jar
